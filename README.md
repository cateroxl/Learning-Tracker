### GOALS

[ ]  Get a functional programming job by the end of 2021 or early 2022. \
[ ] Complete or have at least 3 projects by the end of 2021. \
[ ] Contribute to Open Source Projects. 

### STUDY ROUTINE

Study at least 9 hours a day. Each day, I'm going to read chapters of books and watch videos while making sure that I'm having fun. If I get tired, I'll take a break. I'll be taking down notes and also review during the weekends. 

### CALENDAR

Schedule isn't strict. I learn as I go, and may end up studying topics which I've put on lock. I may or may not add more categories. It really depends on my pace.

#### 2020: NOV - 2021: FEB  
Internet | Frontend | Haskell | Operating System | Git & Github | Databases | APIs

#### 2021: MAR - _ 
Clojure | Databases | APIs | CACHING | WEB SECURITY | _

### MODERN BACKEND DEVELOPER ROADMAP | FUNCTIONAL

Based on Kamran Ahmed's [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).

**NOTE: Each category is linked to a Youtube playlist containing the videos I have watched. I may include in-depth videos that is optional for you to watch too. Also some topics will be linked to invaluable resources that I've read.**
