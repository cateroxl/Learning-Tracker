# LEARNING TRACKER✨

In this Learning Tracker, you'll see my progress in The Modern Backend Developer Roadmap and Teach Yourself CS, along with my goals, study routine and calendar. 

### IMPORTANT

Some trackers will be made soon.

🔹 [Book Trackers](https://github.com/cateroxl/Learning-Tracker/tree/main/Book%20Trackers) \
🔹 Course Trackers \
🔹 [Notes](https://github.com/cateroxl/Learning-Tracker/tree/main/Notes)

### GOALS

[ ] Get a functional programming job in early 2022. \
[ ] Complete or have at least 2 projects. \
[ ] Contribute to Open Source Projects. 

### STUDY ROUTINE

I plan to study for a little more than a year. I believe this to be a great investment because I've always been fascinated in Computer Science and I see myself in it. I want to work with people who wants to make the world a better place through computer technology.  

Each day for ~9 hours, I'm going to read chapters of books and watch videos while making sure that I'm having fun. If I get tired, I'll take a break. I'll be taking down notes and also review during the weekends. 

### CALENDAR

Schedule isn't strict. I learn as I go, and may end up studying topics which I've put on lock. I may or may not add more categories. It really depends on my pace.
